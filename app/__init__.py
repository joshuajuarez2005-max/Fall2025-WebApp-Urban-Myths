This is the __init__.py script 

It acts as tje glue for the entire flask application 

It essentially formats the app/ folder as a package, making our scripts into moduels 
Giving us the ability to basically import scripts 

It also loads the configurations from the config file, and it initalizes extensions, as well
as registering blueprints (routes) into the application
